ImageEffects
============

Apply effects on image.

The EffectFactory class defines the list of available Effects, and provides functionality to inspect and instantiate 
them. Some effects may not be available on all platforms, so before creating a certain effect, the application
should confirm that the effect is supported on this platform by calling isEffectSupported(String).

        EffectFactory class is available from the API level 14. So if you want to use this class then your application
        must have minSdk as 14.
